# Full-stack web developer challenge

First of all, thank you for this opportunity, I never felt the need to learn React/Typescript/Javascript and this was a nice incentive,
which lead me to research and read through React/Typescript tutorials, investigate alternatives and generally "dip my toe" into FrontEnd development.

The codebase I present to you in this repo is in an unfinished state, I took my free time after work during last week to advance bit by bit on the React tutorial I picked: https://handsonreact.com/docs/ and done the work you see here, both frontend and backend, during this weekend. I'm delivering what I have achieved, knowing that it falls very short of the height you set the bar at. I'm writing this at 22:00 on Sunday.

I hate to be apologetic but I'm currently at a really stressful period at my current job: I'm part of a BackEnd development team for a small company in the UK and We are amidst the preparations of a major release into production before christmas, there's a lot of pressure from Product QA, roadmap alignment for next phases and a hefty amount of daily meetings for the preparations.

I'm happy to go through what I was aiming for, I tried to make all my code easily readable so hopefully you can get a rough idea of the direction I was headed with this
